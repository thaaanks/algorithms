* Day 9
Given a positive integer Number, 
return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers 
that are less than or equal to num. 

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1.
Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers.
The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3 and 5.

Example>
sumOddFibonacciNums(10) should return 10
sumOddFibonacciNums(1000) should return 1785
sumOddFibonacciNums(4000000) should return 4613732


function sumOddFibonacciNums(int){
    let fibiArray = [];
    for(let i = 0; i< ; i++){
        let n0 = 1;
        let n1 = 1;
        let n2 = n0 + n1;
        let n3 = n1 + n2;
        let n4 = n2 + n3;

    }
